    <p>Itâ€™s your perception of the truth. No one is special in any good sense. You can list out every bad thing you are, and every bad thing you've ever done, but you can't judge people for the worst decisions they've made, and the aspects of themselves that aren't always pretty. Those alone don't morph your entire being.<br><br>Sometimes it's all about finding someone who appreciates you, and who you appreciate for being themselves. I think that by itself is pretty special. That on its own is enough.
