  <h1>The Seventh Month</h1>
  <h2>by Reuben</h2>
  
    <p>She takes a step outside, attempting to take a deep breath of the fresh air. Instead it is hot, humid, and disgusting. The bugs surround her in the scorching heat, the cars continue to zoom off the road, barely noticing her presence. “That’s life in this city,” she says.<br><br>
      She finds herself walking downtown. You know, the same old place. Same old tracks, same old grass. Same old, same old. Besides a few familiar faces here and there, some forgettable ones come by every now and then. Hi, hello, a small exchange, and then nothing but the same old grass all over again.
