    <h4>Pretty Lips</h4>
      <p>Stay and let me comprehend,<br>
        your hands are in your pockets,<br>
        it's all the same.<br>
        Blank stares on their faces,<br>
        and my ego's been deflated<br>
        once again.<br><br>
        
        
        You try to act like you don't care.<br>
        Your pretty lips are sealed so tightly.<br>
        Where do I begin?<br>
        I'm clothed in sadness just like I used to.<br>
        Would you ever call me a fool?<br><br>
        
        
        [I think I'll start over again.]<br><br>
        
        Stay and let me comprehend,<br>
        your hands are in your pockets,<br>
        it's all the same.<br>
        Blank stares on their faces,<br>
        and my ego's been deflated<br>
        once again.<br>
        Another day is over,<br>
        and the ashened sky<br>
        it hasn't changed.<br>
        Float in silent memory,<br> 
        a decision that is<br>
        never made.<br><br>
        
        You try to act like you don't care.<br>
        Your pretty lips are sealed so tightly.<br>
        Where do I begin?<br>
        I'm clothed in sadness just like I used to.<br>
        Would you ever call me a fool if I ever tell you?<br>
      </p>

    <h4>Maroon Shoes</h4>
      <p>It's you,<br>
        you I still think about.<br>
        Why do I feel this way?<br>
        you, you with the maroon shoes.<br><br>
        
        I'm done trying,<br>
        you're done with me.<br>
        I'm done trying.<br><br>
        
        
        It's you,<br>
        you I wanna be with,<br>
        but I'm still lost.<br>
        I'm gonna miss you<br>
        when you leave this little place.<br><br>
        
        Walk a day in my shoes<br>
        to know how it feels.<br>
        Walk a day in my shoes.<br><br>
        
        I'm done trying,<br>
        you're done with me<br>
        I'm done trying.<br>
      </p>

    <h4>The May Happenings</h4>
      <p>The anticipation weighs me down<br>
        like an endless maze.<br>
        Stemming from my doubts,<br>
        can't figure out what it is<br>
        you want to do.<br><br>
        
        
        For the rain<br>
        has become too strong.<br>
        The May happenings, so far,<br>
        have been unpredictable.<br>
        The sweet sound<br>
        of the raindrops falling down.<br>
        Somehow I wish this story wouldn't end.<br>
        Oh but the days, they fly by so fast.<br><br>
        
        
        The anticipation weighs me down<br>
        like an endless maze.<br>
        Stemming from my doubts,<br>
        can't figure out what it is<br>
        you want to do.<br><br>
        
        
        Do you believe in happy endings?<br>
        I'm unsure how this would end.<br>
        In the subway, the same metallic smell.<br>
        I find myself surrounded by<br><br>
        
        A sea of people in their own little worlds.<br>
        Somehow I wish you were here.<br>
        Somehow I wish this story wouldn't end.<br>
        Oh but the days, they fly by so fast.<br><br>
        
        Hold on to me.<br>
        Go on and tell me<br>
        how you truly feel.<br><br>
        
        The anticipation weighs me down<br>
        like an endless maze.<br>
        Stemming from my doubts,<br>
        can't figure out what it is<br>
        you want to do.<br><br>
        
        
        I can be myself around you, did you know?<br>
        If I had the chance to tell you, I'd let you know<br>
        I'd miss you.<br>
      </p>

    <h4>July Sky</h4>
      <p>Lost, I've been lost for awhile now<br>
        You decided leaving me hanging was for the best<br>
        You, you told me I was sweet<br>
        I was thinking as I walked down the New York streets<br><br>
        
        That you, you left me<br>
        for a reason I could never comprehend<br>
        but as of now<br><br>
        
        I don’t really care about the person you once knew<br>
        I don’t really care if what you said to me was true<br>
        I don’t really care if you call me a fool<br>
        I don’t really care anymore<br><br>
        
        We were doing alright<br>
        but we crashed down the waters and sank<br>
        We, we were gonna walk down the street<br>
        and grab some coffee while watching the sun set<br><br>
        
        But you, you left me<br>
        for a reason I could never comprehend<br>
        but as of now<br><br>
        
        I don’t really care about the person you once knew<br>
        I don’t really care if what you said to me was true<br>
        I don’t really care if you call me a fool<br>
        I don’t really care anymore<br><br>
        
        I stare right at the July sky<br>
        the rain keeps pouring down<br>
        but I don’t really care anymore<br>
        I don’t really care anymore<br>
      </p>
    <br>

    <h4>Depend</h4>
      <p>You said "It's okay, you can do it."<br>
        You were always here for me<br>
        You never failed to make me happy<br>
        I wish that you stayed the same<br><br>
        
        Sometimes the people who inspire you<br>
        will hurt you the most<br>
        Sometimes the people whom you care for<br>
        will hurt you the most<br><br>
        
        Don't depend on broader shoulders<br>
        to carry your weight<br>
        They will give up on you anyway<br>
      </p>

    <h4>The Little Conversations</h4>
      <p>What happened<br>
        to the happy days?<br>
        What happened<br>
        to the you I used to know?<br><br>
        
        When I see you once again<br>
        I'll make sure to tell you<br>
        that I missed you after all this time<br>
        but we're more different than I thought<br><br>
        
        What happened<br>
        to the little conversations we had?<br>
        What happened<br>
        to all the silly jokes you used to make?<br><br>
        
        When I see you once again<br>
        I'll make sure to tell you<br>
        When I see you once again<br>
        I'll make sure to say<br>
        thank you anyway<br>
      </p>

    <h4>Defender</h4>
      <p>Maybe it’s time I say<br>
        goodbye to the sad days.<br>
        Maybe it’s time I go<br>
        back to where I was.<br>
        Consistently looking <br>
        for an answer<br>
        to the very same question<br>
        I've always had.<br><br>
        
        Looking at the<br>
        defender of the people,<br>
        and the wolves,<br>
        I stare at the stars,<br>
        the constellations,<br>
        the dark sky.<br><br>
         
        Looking at the<br>
        blooming plant<br>
        by the pavement,<br>
        I stare at the stars,<br>
        the constellations,<br>
        the dark sky,<br>
        will I be happy?<br><br>
        
        Maybe it’s time I say<br>
        goodbye to the bitter days.<br>
        Maybe it’s time I go<br>
        back to where I was.<br>
        Consistently looking <br>
        for an answer<br>
        to the very same question<br>
        I've always had.<br>
        
        Looking at the<br>

        and the wolves,<br>
        I stare at the stars,<br>
        the constellations,<br>
        the dark sky.<br><br>
         
        Looking at the<br>
        blooming plant<br>
        by the pavement,<br>
        I stare at the stars,<br>
        the constellations,<br>
        the dark sky,<br>
        will I be happy?<br><br>
        
        I hope I'll be.
