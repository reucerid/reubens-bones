    <h4>Autumn</h4>
      <p>Looking back to, back to, back to<br>
        autumn of last year<br>
        It used to, used to be so melancholic<br>
        now it isn't anymore<br><br>
        
        I will at least<br>
        just keep on moving forward<br>
        I will at least<br>
        just keep on walking down this road<br><br>
        
        I used to be so afraid, so sad<br>
        It felt like a necessity<br>
        a constant daydream<br>
        reality and falsehood meaning the same<br>
        a beast lurking in the streets<br>
        black ink leaking through the sidewalk<br><br>

    <h4>Magenta</h4>
      <p>He lights up<br>
        her gloomy days<br>
        She looks at him<br>
        like there's no tomorrow<br>
        They lie on the floor<br>
        and she says,<br>
        "You got long lashes,<br>
        I like it."<br>
        He turns to her and says,<br>
        "I don't."<br><br>
        
        But he lights up<br>
        her gloomy days<br>
        He kisses her<br>
        like there's no tomorrow<br>
        They lie on the floor<br>
        and he says,<br>
        "You sure you're alright<br>
        with doing nothing?<br>
        It seems like you're only<br>
        putting up with my sh*t."<br><br>
        
        But he lights up<br>
        her gloomy days<br>
        He makes her heart<br>
        feel so warm<br><br>
        
        She hopes he knows<br>
        he's fine the way is<br>

    <h4>Under the Full Moon</h4>
      <p>And we kissed under<br>
        under the full moon<br>
        What does that mean to you?<br>
        What does that mean?<br><br>
        
        You make me live my life<br>
        more happily<br><br>
        
        We found ourselves driving under<br>
        under the city's silhouette<br><br>
        
        You make me live my life<br>
        more happily<br>
        You make me live my life<br>
        more happily<br>
      </p>

    <h4>Make Believe</h4>
      <p>How come I always forget<br>
        I could just be myself, and nobody else<br>
        A burden’s all that I’ll ever be, but then you tell me<br><br>
        
        Oh please,<br>
        Oh please,<br>
        It’s all make-believe<br><br>
        
        How come I always forget<br>
        I could maybe talk less and listen to everybody else<br>
        A nuisance is all that I’ll ever be, but then you tell me<br><br>
        
        Oh please,<br>
        Oh please,<br>
        It’s all make-believe<br>
      </p>
