  <h1>The heart that rules</h1>
  <h2>by Reuben</h2>
  
    <p>It's funny how you never truly understand your emotions until you accept them. Until you embrace and tell 
      yourself what you are feeling is valid, because it is. It always will be. The emotions that come rushing 
      when you see the person that matters to you the most, when you encounter your very own enemy, 
      when you see someone you've been wanting to embrace, we can't control them. It's the heart that rules them
      â€”the things that don't seem to make sense, the feelings that don't seem to be rational, yet here we are, 
      feeling them anyway.<br><br>

      It always tends to slip away from people's minds, but there will always be things that we can't understand.<br><br>
      
      The point is, sometimes we don't have to understand.<br><br>

      Accepting that is essential to becoming happier.
