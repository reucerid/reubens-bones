  <h1>Two Worlds</h1>
  <h2>by Reuben and Ashley</h2>
  
    <p>The library<br>
        Table, notebook,<br>
        pencil, highlighter<br>
        A red woman<br>
        soft singing
        Drawing a purple castle<br>
        Teacher stopped<br>
        “Hey, work”<br>
        Loud, strong.<br>
        Hated, ignored.<br>
        Lousy backpack<br>
        The lady hopped,<br>
        ran, swam, played,<br>
        And explored the United States;<br><br>
        A boy student,<br>
        Ugly, quiet, eleven.<br>
        Walking,<br>
        Oh, school is hard.<br>
        Read a book<br>
        Pen and paper, write.<br>
        Horse is white,<br>
        Acting, jumping.<br>
        Is man a pet?<br>
        Starting a dance,<br>
        But quitting.<br>
        Ouch.<br>
        Is a room a house?<br>
        Was the park pretty or hot?<br>
        Fishing and staring.<br>
        Help, share.<br>
    </p>
