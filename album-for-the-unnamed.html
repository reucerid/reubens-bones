    <h4>The Stars are Fire</h4>
      <p>The dark days are over,<br>
      I’ll finally get to see you again.<br>
      You were the shelter of my heart.<br><br>
      
      It’s such a beautiful sight,<br>
      the stars are fire.<br>
      I say to myself,<br>
      "Will it ever be the same?"<br><br>
      
      The warmth of your words,<br>
      The warmth of your words,<br>
      I know that I’m a coward,<br>
      Will you tell me I’m not?<br><br>
      
      Sick of this desire,<br>
      Sick of this desire,<br>
      I’ve been feeling empty,<br>
      Are you able to patch up the hole?<br><br>
      
      Walking in the streets to pass time.<br>
      Apparently, it’s not working at all.<br>
      You were the shelter of my heart.<br><br>
      
      Your soothing voice,<br>
      I miss it.<br>
      I say to myself,<br>
      "Will it ever sound the same?"<br><br>
      
      The warmth of your words,<br>
      The warmth of your words,<br>
      I know that I’m a coward,<br>
      Will you tell me I’m not?<br><br>
      
      Sick of this desire,<br>
      Sick of this desire,<br>
      I’ve been feeling empty,<br>
      Are you able to patch up the hole?<br><br>
      
      Save me from this loneliness.<br>
      The warmth of your words,<br>
      I want to feel the warmth of your words.<br></p>

    <h4>Hello There, Lonely Nights</h4>
      <p>
        Tell me one thing,<br>
        do you actually care?<br>
        Something doesn’t feel<br>
        Something doesn’t feel right.<br>
        Would you stay close to me,<br>
        and look me in the eye?<br>
        Would you hold my hand,<br>
        and tell me it’s fine?<br><br>
        
        The sky is getting dark,<br>
        but your eyes are still bright.<br>
        Something doesn’t feel<br>
        Something doesn’t feel right.<br>
        Hello there, lonely nights,<br>
        it’s been awhile.<br>
        Soon the sky is gonna cry,<br>
        cry with me.<br>
      </p>

    <h4>Two Sad Souls</h4>
      <p> “Goodbye,” I say with a smile,<br>
          you wave as you walk your own path.<br>
          I stay as I watch you get farther,<br>
          and farther away from me.<br><br>
          
          And the tears,<br>
          they keep falling down.<br>
          We’ll see what we’ll be<br>
          and where this goes.<br><br>
          
          “I’m fine,” I say with a smile,<br>
          keeping my head up, and my spirits high.<br>
          I stay as I watch you get farther,<br>
          and farther away from me.<br><br>
          
          Somehow, I think<br>
          we’re just two sad souls,<br>
          wandering, forever lost.<br><br>
          
          And the tears,<br>
          they keep falling down.<br>
          We’ll see what we’ll be<br>
          and where this goes.<br><br>
          
          Oh, the tears,<br>
          they keep falling down.<br>
          So please, tell me<br>
          where you plan to go.<br>
      </p>

    <h4>October Weather</h4>
      <p>It hurts so much.<br>
          This bitter life I’m living<br>
          has no happy ending.<br>
          It hurts so much.<br>
          This October weather<br>
          is slowly changing me and you.<br><br>
          
          Hold on, there’s something else<br>
          I want to say before you go.<br>
          Hold on, just tell me one more time,<br>
          “It’s alright, you’ll be fine.”<br>
          Am I alright? I don’t think I’ll be fine.<br>
      </p>
