    <h4>Chamomile</h4>
      <p> My dear chamomile,<br>
          how to let it go and let it be like a lull<br>
          in a sea of words to comprehend?<br><br>
          
          So when the sun rises<br>
          see the beauty of the trees<br>
          Can you reassure me<br>
          everything will be alright as can be?<br><br>
          
          I don't know what I'm supposed to do<br>
          when you're not here to talk to<br>
          My only ever chamomile, I'll hold dear<br><br>
          
          My dear chamomile,<br>
          May your wishes come true to life and bring you joy<br>
          that you deserve<br><br>
          
          So when we see the moon,<br>
          we'll listen to some evening songs<br>
          We'll talk throughout the night<br>
          while cosmic stardust circles you and me<br><br>
          
          I don't know what I should do<br>
          when you're not here to listen<br>
          My only ever chamomile, I'll hold dear<br><br>
          
          Stay the way you are<br>
          I'll always be glad we met<br>
          An ever calming presence<br>
          who wouldn't lie<br><br>
          
          Always so serene<br>
          My only ever chamomile, I'll hold dear<br>
      </p>
