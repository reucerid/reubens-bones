  <h1>One time I got lost on my way home</h1>
  <h2>by Reuben</h2>
  
    <p> Walking home from school, I looked left and right. The houses did not look familiar. The ground felt foreign. The skies seemed too belittling. <br><br>

        A sudden urge of panic came rushing through me--something was wrong. Only then did I realize I was going the wrong way. Turning left, turning right, I eventually found myself at the familiar side of the neighborhood. I still did not know how to get home from there, however. So fourteen-year old me from 2016 decided to keep walking down the hill.<br><br>
        
        An old woman facing back was sweeping her front yard. She was big-boned and had white hair reaching down her neck. I was relieved. Finally, someone to ask for directions.<br><br>
        
        "Excuse me, ma'am," I tried to get her attention. The old woman did not turn around.<br><br>
        
        "Ma'am?" I said again. But still, no answer.<br><br>
        
        Fourteen-year old me from 2016 decided to do nothing but stare at the old woman. I was either going to ask this person or be lost forever.<br><br>
        
        The old woman turned around after a few seconds of staring. <br><br>
        
        "Yes?" She wasn't an old woman. She turned out to be an old man, an old man with an intriguingly deep voice.<br><br>
        
        "Oh god I'm so sorry," I was embarrassed. I mean, who wouldn't be?<br><br>
        
        "What do you want?" The old woman--I mean, man--asked. I couldn't tell if he was annoyed by my presence or the fact that I was standing on his front yard.<br><br>
        
        I asked him for directions. He told me where to go. So I decided to keep walking down the hill.<br><br>
        
        I never saw the old man again.
