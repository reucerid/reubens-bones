  <h1>Little Boy</h1>
  <h2>by Reuben</h2>
  
    <p>"Little boy, don't go in there," said the old man, grabbing the boy's shoulder.<br>
      But the boy couldn't see him. He couldn't even feel the man's hands.<br><br>
      
      "So cold..." said the little boy, turning his head both ways. "Mom?" He called out, trying to feel his mother's hands. "Mom?" He called out again.<br><br>
      
      Silence. Only silence called out.<br><br>
      
      He was blind.<br><br>
      
      He didn't know where he was going. Just a few minutes ago, they were at the carnival. Crowded, carnivals are always crowded. What a foolish parent, one might say.<br><br>
      
      The little boy was now walking to the direction of the abandoned school on the night of a full moon, being warned by someone he couldn't see nor hear.<br><br>
      
      "Little boy, don't go. You have to run." <br><br>
      
      Still, he couldn't hear him.<br><br>
      
      The old man knew he had to rescue him. He had to do something, but he couldn't.<br><br>
      
      He was only a ghost after all.<br><br>
