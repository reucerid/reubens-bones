  <h1>Monday, 15:37</h1>
  <h2>It's been a week since I've heard from you</h2>
  
    <p>I understand if you don't feel like talking to anyone. I want to be here for you, and maybe someone who can articulate things easily isn't the person you want to be around with or talk to right now, but I want you to know that people will be here, always will be, when you need it the most. <br><br>
      I get it, I've been through it, and you've honestly handled so much. I am so so proud of you. You're strong, but it's easy to forget that. Somehow it just feels like the light at the end of the tunnel that you can never reach. It feels like a helpless situation, the same cycle over and over and over again. <br><br>
      If you need to be alone for much longer, I will respect that decision. I respect if you need space, but I can't respect that if I know it's hurting you, and right now there is no way to know. Take care of yourself. You will get through this, trust me. <br><br>
      I hope this message reaches you. Love, just know I will be with you. We care about you, and we love you, I love you. I'm here, always. I'm here now, and I'll be here when you're back.
    </p>
